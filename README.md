# Google Homepage Clone

A simple webpage mimicking the appearance of the Google homepage, built using CSS Flexbox & HTML5

Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum

## Self Reflection
Using HTML and CSS efficiently is a lot more difficult than I remembered it being when I played around with web development as a child.
I am pretty fond of using Flexbox though, but I'm sure I need mor experience in becoming familiar with it. 
Admittedly, I'm still quite a newbie when it comes to the typical developer's Git workflow so I only committed the project when I finished it, realizing that I should have committed in small chunks too late! Will definitely try to avoid this in future projects.
Overall, a good starting point for my web-dev journey!
